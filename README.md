This repository contains solutions to control engineering exercises focusing on **block diagram reduction, state-space control, and system simulation**.  

The problems involve simplifying a **SISO system block diagram**, designing a **full-state feedback controller**, and analyzing a **hydraulic position servo** system. Solutions include **eigenvalue analysis, controllability verification, pole placement**, and **Simulink simulations** to evaluate system responses. Comparisons between different system configurations and their effects on performance are also presented.  

All solutions include supporting **code and documentation** for clarity and reproducibility.
